Generate AI 3D models inside Grasshopper for Rhino 8


- The maximum prompt length is a few thousand words. Longer prompts usually take longer to respond.
- Shorter prompts, 1-2 sentences in length, succeed more often than longer prompts.
- If your prompt omits important dimensions, Text-to-CAD will make its best guess to fill in missing details.
- Traditional, simple mechanical parts work best right now - fasteners, bearings, connectors, etc.
- Text-to-CAD returns a 500 error code if it fails to generate a valid geometry internally, even if it understands your prompt.
- The same prompt can generate different results when submitted multiple times. Sometimes a failing prompt will succeed on the next attempt, and vice versa.
